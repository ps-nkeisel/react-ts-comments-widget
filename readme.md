# ðŸ’¬ Comments Widget

Part of Comment widgets to allow users to write comments. This widget is created/loaded on article by `platform.js`

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm i
```

## Development Setup

This command runs development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

```sh
npm run start
```

Widget started on development server doesn't provide you with whole functional. Since Comment widgets depend on communication between them there are several limitations.
You can check these limitations by opening `Communication` file. There you can find messages we expect to receive from other widgets or methods we use to send information to other widgets. In development mode you can mock messages by using method `window.windowProxy.post([message])` in a browser console.

## Running the tests

```sh
npm run test
```

This command runs jest tests.
